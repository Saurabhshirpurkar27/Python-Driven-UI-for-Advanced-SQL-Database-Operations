A full-stack data application built using **Python (Streamlit)** and **MySQL** that allows users to interact with a database **without writing SQL queries**.

This project demonstrates how real-world business systems are built by combining a strong SQL backend with an intuitive Python-based frontend.

## 📌 Overview

In many organizations, **managers, team leads, and operations staff** need access to data stored in databases but **do not know SQL**.  
This project solves that problem by providing a **web-based UI** that performs advanced SQL operations behind the scenes.

Users can view data, run business logic, and update records using simple buttons and forms.

## 🔧 How the Project Works

### Step 1: MySQL Database (Backend)

The database is designed to simulate real business systems.

**Database Components:**
- Tables for products, orders, inventory, and shipments
- Views for reports and summaries
- Stored Procedures for actions like order processing and stock updates
- Functions for business logic such as restocking checks

Business rules are enforced directly at the database level.

---

### Step 2: Streamlit Application (Frontend)

The Streamlit web app allows users to:

- View and filter data from tables and views
- Run stored procedures using buttons
- Add or update records using forms
- Execute database functions for calculations
- See real-time results without writing SQL

---

## ✨ Key Features

- No-SQL interface for non-technical users
- Real-time database interaction
- Advanced SQL usage (views, procedures, functions)
- Clean and interactive UI
- Multi-layer architecture (Frontend + Backend)

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Advanced SQL (Views, Stored Procedures, Functions)
- Database design for real-world use cases
- Python–MySQL integration
- Streamlit UI development
- Backend and frontend coordination
- Business logic implementation
