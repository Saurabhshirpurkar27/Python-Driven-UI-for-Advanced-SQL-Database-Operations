# Python-Driven-UI-for-Advanced-SQL-Database-Operations
This project is about building a powerful web-based application using Python (Streamlit) that lets users interact with a MySQL database without needing to write any SQL code.  In the real world, many people (like managers or team leads) need to work with data stored in databases, but they don't know SQL .
